This data set comes under classification problem, as the input URL is classified as phishing (1) or legitimate (0). The supervised machine learning models (classification) considered to train the dataset in this project are:

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Support Vector Machines
4. KNN
5. ANN

All these models are trained on the dataset and evaluation of the model is done with the test dataset
